Description:
The idea is to create a bot for the game Pacman. The bot will control Pacman and try to beat all the levels. This includes avoiding the ghosts, eating all the pieces, and doing this in an efficient manner.
We aim to use search methods to find the shortest weighted paths that Pacman should travel through to advance in the game. We have not finalized on which search methods to utilize, but they may include depth-first search and A* Search.

Expected Outcome:
Our goal is to create a bot that develops intelligence after a few rounds of Pacman, and eventually completes the game with the best score possible. Although the bot may initially do poorly, by the end of several runs, it should have improved greatly.
